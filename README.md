## Features

### 🧾 Commit Diff — Review one immutable local Git commit

Commit Diff accepts a hexadecimal commit ID and creates one evidence-linked,
self-contained offline HTML review. It compares the commit with its first
parent by default, supports an explicit parent for merge commits, and compares
a root commit with Git's empty tree.

The collector reads committed Git objects instead of the worktree. Staged,
unstaged, and untracked files cannot change the captured review. It preserves
bounded input, redaction, evidence validation, temporary-state ownership, and
atomic publication guarantees.

Commit Diff runs only when it is explicitly invoked:

```text
Use $hope:commit to review commit f6363ced in this repository and create Korean HTML.
```

### 🤝 Align — Reach shared understanding before implementation and prevent `intent debt`

Align reviews the request against verifiable evidence, maps every material
intent decision, and interviews the person in dependency-aware rounds. Each
answer reshapes the remaining questions; Align finishes only after no material
decision remains and the person confirms the complete intent in a teach-back.

When the agreed intent needs a durable record for later work or review, or the
person asks for an artifact, Align writes one self-contained HTML record inside
the project. A small, clear task that will continue in the current session can
stay in the conversation without creating a file.

The record preserves one agreed goal and problem, the observable outcomes that
define the decided intent, deliberately excluded work, and any user flow that
needs sequence. It excludes
solution design, implementation details, current implementation state, and
completion results. Later work may consult it as evidence of intent, but it is
not an implementation contract or current-system specification.

When a material visual choice cannot be settled honestly through conversation,
Align checks the project first and presents two or three image mockups as
evidence for that choice. It does not turn every UI task into a design exercise.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generated Align records are project documentation. Later version-control work
> includes them with related project changes unless the person excludes them.

**Complete example HTML:** [Open the English Align record for a fan schedule that
makes source conflicts, changes, cancellations, and judgment responsibility
explicit.](docs/alignments/rescene-fan-calendar.en.html)

The captures below come from this example. It uses sample data and does not
represent the live `rescene.fan` interface.

### 🔎 Diff — Understand what changed and how to judge it to prevent `cognitive debt`

A code change can be complete while its owner still cannot predict, explain, or
judge it, and that gap is cognitive debt.

Diff creates one HTML artifact that explains behavior before code and links
important claims to evidence.

It may use visuals, a microworld, or a quiz to help the reader explore the
change.

The artifact helps the reader understand and judge the change, then use that
understanding in follow-up decisions and work.

> [!NOTE]
> With no URL, Diff first looks for the current branch's pull request.
> If none exists, it selects your latest open pull request in the repository.
> Run Diff again when the pull request changes.

The captures below come from a fixed English Diff example based on
[Ky PR #867](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky/pull/867).

**Complete example HTML:** [Open the English Diff artifact for Ky PR #867 with
its retry-configuration microworld and quiz.](docs/diffs/ky-867-retry-extend.en.html)

### ⚖️ Toxic Review — Put a work product through a rigorous Red–Blue review

Red finds. Blue challenges. The active agent judges.

Independent Red reviewers probe distinct material risks. Every high-priority
finding, every finding that proposes a broad or difficult-to-reverse action,
and every materially uncertain finding receives a fresh Blue verifier. Blue
separately challenges the issue, impact, scope, and proposed action against the
sealed finding and scoped evidence.

The active agent retains final judgment, records each candidate's disposition
and each actionable candidate's final priority, and reports findings no more
strongly than the evidence supports.

> [!TIP]
> Ask Hope to limit the Red reviewer count when you want a smaller routine run.
> Review size alone does not add Blue, but high-priority, broad-action, or
> materially uncertain findings still require it.

### 🧹 Sweep — Clean up a codebase

Sweep runs only when explicitly invoked. It immediately applies proven,
behavior-preserving cleanup.

Sweep uses the entire current repository unless the request names a narrower
scope inside it.

It cleans up:

- dead code and its dedicated tests, documentation, configuration, generation,
  and assets;
- duplicated implementations, unnecessary work, and needless indirection;
- abstractions that are missing, excessive, or owned by the wrong boundary;
- documentation, comments, examples, and configuration that no longer match
  the code; and
- the minimum tests or checks needed to refactor safely.

Bug fixes, behavior or public-contract changes, product decisions, and
uncertain removals remain outside Sweep.

### ✍️ Write — Make language clearer without losing meaning

Hope also uses Write within other tasks, including implementation and other
Skills.

Write's shared standard adapts George Orwell's six rules in
[Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/).

  `gh auth login` first if needed.

> [!TIP]
> The simplest option is to ask an AI:
>
> ```text
> Install Hope Commit from https://github.com/ljkhyeong/hope-commit for this host.
> Follow the repository README and tell me if I need to restart.
> ```

To install it yourself, run the commands for your host.

For example:

```bash
# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add ljkhyeong/hope-commit
codex plugin add hope@hope-commit
```

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add ljkhyeong/hope-commit
claude plugin install hope@hope-commit
