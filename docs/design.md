# Hope design

This document defines Hope's project-wide GUI guidance and the visual contracts
of the current Align, Diff, and Commit Diff HTML artifacts.

The Project GUI layout and Project GUI widgets sections apply whenever a Hope
feature introduces or changes a matching layout, control, or interaction.

Feature-named sections apply only to that artifact. Sections named for Hope
artifacts apply to all three.

The Align, Diff, and Commit Diff Skills own their feature judgment and prose.

Align defines the shared artifact visual baseline. Diff matches that baseline
for common color, type, spacing, product-bar, document, and navigation roles.
Each feature still owns its visual tokens and renderer. No renderer imports
another feature's renderer at runtime.

Do not introduce a shared artifact framework until two real consumers need the
same invariant.

## Project GUI layout

Show each piece of information once in a viewport. A responsive layout may move
it, but must not leave a second visible copy.

Define spacing and alignment through layout groups. Do not correct one element
with an isolated margin when the relationship belongs to the group.

Derive the position of a connecting line, arrow, or other annotation from the
same layout structure as the element it identifies. Do not maintain
independent hand-tuned coordinates.

When space becomes too narrow, move needed information and actions into a
compact form that preserves access. Do not merely hide or squeeze them.

Keep body prose in one reading column. On a wide screen, use parallel columns
only for a short comparison summary whose options are easier to scan together.
Limit each comparison cell to a title, visual when useful, brief summary, and
brief points on the same comparison axes; put longer supporting explanation
below in the single reading flow. Stack comparison cells when the viewport is
narrow. Navigation, labels, tables, diagrams, and controls are structural UI
rather than prose columns and follow the structure they need.

Preserve an authored semantic paragraph as a separate HTML paragraph. Do not
collapse distinct paragraphs into one run of text or use layout columns to
create paragraph boundaries.

Use the same small set of semantic section patterns across Align, Diff, and
Commit Diff:

- structured label-and-value rows for summaries, with the goal first;
- parallel cells only for brief comparisons that must be scanned together;
- one ordered vertical sequence for behavior or process;
- visible conclusions with native disclosures for reasons;
- compact inline markers for evidence and judgment methods; and
- numbered inline evidence references with one folded source list at the end.

When one claim cites several numbered evidence entries, display that marker
group in ascending document-number order. Keep each source's assigned number
and the final source-list order unchanged.

Keep summary labels compact without changing their wording. In Korean, when a
summary label consists of two two-syllable words, stack one word per line in
the label gutter while preserving the space in its text and accessible name.

## Hope artifact layout

Use one linear document at every viewport. Place the unnumbered document title
first, then start the numbered reading areas with a visible `01 Summary`. Show
the same number beside each area title and table-of-contents link. Number
conditional areas in rendered order and leave no gap when one is omitted. Keep
each section number the same type size and line height as its title.

Give every numbered area a blue section number, text-colored title, and one
clear divider directly below its title. Do not add a second rule above the
area. Use 40 pixels between the document title and Summary, then 48 pixels
between later areas on a wide screen and 40 pixels on a narrow screen. Use the
smaller steps in this shared spacing scale within an area:

```text
4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 32 · 40 · 48 · 64
```

On a wide screen, place a compact table-of-contents rail beside the document
when it improves navigation. On a narrow screen, move the same navigation into
a bounded panel opened from a control beside the display controls. Preserve the
reading order and access to every item instead of hiding or squeezing them.

Keep the Hope brand, repository identity, artifact status, and controls in one
compact product bar. Group the language dropdown and bordered theme button as
one display control, separate from navigation. Use one gap between the brand,
repository, status, and action group, and the next smaller gap between controls
inside the action group. Do not correct an individual item with a one-off
margin.

Render an ordered behavior or process as one connected vertical sequence. Keep
each two-digit step number beside its title and put the detail below. Use
horizontal columns only for direct comparison.

Give the document title enough emphasis to establish the reading path, then
keep body type compact and readable. Use thin dividers instead of enclosing
ordinary content in cards. Omit an optional area instead of rendering an empty
box.

## Diff artifact direction

The Diff artifact should feel:

- direct;
- compact;
- calm;
- easy to scan; and
- clearly divided without looking boxed in.

Use familiar words, short sentences, and one clear reading path.

Prefer useful content over decoration.

Use the current Align artifact as the primary reference for common visual
roles.

The Diff feature's `scripts/design/tokens.mjs` is the code source of truth for
its values. Common roles match the corresponding Align values without importing
Align code. Diff-only code and status roles remain local to Diff.

The Diff renderer must read those tokens instead of copying their values.

Commit Diff follows the same artifact direction and semantic structure. It
replaces pull-request identity with one reviewed local Git commit and its
selected parent. Its renderer and tokens stay inside the Commit Diff Skill and
do not import Diff at runtime.

## Diff artifact structure

The first screen should explain the shape and limits of the change in about 30
seconds.

Show a plain-language title written from the changed behavior, reviewed commit,
goal, previous and new behavior, practical impact, the top one to three review
items or a clear empty result, and material review limits. Keep the provider's
pull-request title in the collapsed review information instead of using it as
the document title. Let the title name one decisive result; keep secondary
mechanics in the summary when they make the title harder to scan.

Compare the brief previous and new behavior summaries side by side on a wide
screen and stack them in that order on a narrow screen. Keep the practical
impact and every longer explanation in the single reading flow below the
comparison.

Keep internal source IDs, model details, token counts, processing state, and
capture time out of the first screen.

Use four top-level reading areas and omit a conditional area when it adds no
value:

1. Summary
2. Behavior change
3. Review items
4. Evidence and scope

Summary previews the most important review items. Keep the complete **Review
items** section in a native disclosure that starts closed; a fragment link to a
specific item opens it. This keeps the first reading path focused without
removing the full finding, effect, next step, completion condition, or evidence.

Keep background in Summary. In Behavior change, show the core change first,
then any behavior model, the understanding check, and teaching aid choices.
Give each behavior model a visible subheading so its application conditions
and flow cannot look like another core-change claim. Teaching aid choices and
understanding checks are supporting details, not parallel top-level
destinations.

Let the reading path answer these questions in order:

1. What changed?
2. Why does it matter?
3. How do previous and new behavior differ?
4. Under which conditions does the outcome change?
5. What did the review find, and what limited the judgment?
6. What implementation and evidence support that explanation?

This is a reader-question order, not a fixed six-question template. Omit a
question that does not apply instead of creating an empty or repetitive block.

Explain behavior before code. Keep functions, types, file mechanics, and code
steps in a collapsed **Implementation details** group inside Evidence and
scope. In the main path, translate source states and callback return values into
the human choice, condition, and outcome they represent.

Show only the code excerpts needed for understanding instead of reproducing the
full diff.

Put a quiet numbered reference such as `[1]` immediately after every grounded
claim. Reuse the number when the same source interval supports another claim.
Activating the reference shows a bounded preview popover anchored to that
reference. Place it below the marker when space allows, flip it above when
needed, and keep it within the viewport. Its ordinary fragment link remains
useful without JavaScript and leads to the canonical source entry.

Collect the complete numbered source list in one native disclosure at the end
of Evidence and scope. Start it closed on screen and reveal it for fragment
navigation and print. Keep code excerpts there instead of repeating them below
each claim.

Do not repeat a plain **Code** or equivalent basis label when the numbered
reference already links the claim to captured code. Keep a basis label only
when it changes how the reader should judge the claim, such as an inference, a
source statement, or something Hope could not confirm. Write those remaining
labels as explicit phrases beside the claim and its evidence marker rather than
as a separate metadata row. A teaching aid's evidence marker belongs beside
the caption or instruction it supports, not alone at the end of the component.

Use Evidence and scope as the complete index of the captured snapshot, checked
files, supporting sources, exclusions, and limits.

This order follows evidence that context before a passage improves
comprehension and recall
([Bransford and Johnson, 1972](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80006-9)),
pre-training helps people build a mental model
([Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell, 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12240927/)),
and headings and previews direct attention
([Lorch and Lorch, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.88.1.38)). Keep
secondary implementation mechanics folded while the reader builds that model
to reduce competing processing
([Sweller, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4)). Use a diagram
only when its spatial structure makes a relationship or inference easier to
find than prose
([Larkin and Simon, 1987](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1551-6708.1987.tb00863.x)).

## Align artifact direction

The Align artifact should feel like a compact intent record: direct, quiet,
easy to scan, and complete enough to preserve what the person meant without
describing the solution or implemented result.

The Align feature's `scripts/design/tokens.mjs` owns its exact visual values.
Diff rendering, Diff tokens, and removed Align implementations do not constrain
it.

## Align artifact structure

The artifact is the current agreed intent. It is not a solution design,
implementation contract, current-system description, or progress tracker.

Show each fact once, in this order:

1. title, then a summary containing only the one-sentence goal and problem;
2. decided intent as the canonical observable outcome statements, followed by
   an optional person-visible or domain-visible flow and a compact list of what
   is not included;
3. compared design directions and the selected option, only when the
   person-facing experience needed visual agreement;
4. supporting evidence, only when it adds a source that matters.

Positive intent statements define what is included. Do not repeat them in a
scope list, expected-behavior section, boundary section, or decision section.
Attach a material reason to the statement it explains. Show a flow only when
sequence or branching adds information that the statements do not already
carry. Put deferred product work in **Not included**.

Do not show unresolved intent in a ready artifact. A material unresolved intent
means alignment is not ready. Put deliberately deferred work in **Not
included**, and leave research or implementation uncertainty in the work that
owns it. Earlier artifact versions may retain their historical fields, but the
current record follows this structure.

Keep earlier versions in the secondary version history navigation. Do not
repeat version history at the bottom of the agreement.

Label the current version **current intent**, not with language that implies an
external approval workflow or current implementation state. Do not repeat the
record in a separate contract or implementation summary.

Keep decided outcomes, exclusions, and any necessary user flow visible. Fold
judgment methods, intent reasons, option references, and the
supporting-evidence section. Put `[n]` after a claim only when its structured
value names a validated evidence ID. Reuse that number throughout the current
intent, show a bounded preview popover when it is activated, and keep the
complete numbered evidence list in the final folded section. Unreferenced
supporting evidence stays in that list without an invented claim link. Use
these information roles directly; do not add length or item-count thresholds
that make the same field change layout unpredictably.

Show each decided intent item as one visible observable condition. Put `[AI]` after a
condition an AI agent can assess and `[User]` or the locale's equally compact
user label after one that needs a person's judgment. Activating the marker
opens the way to recognize the condition in a bounded popover anchored to that
marker. Keep the complete judgment methods in one folded list at the end of the
decided-intent section so fragment navigation and print preserve them. Do not turn them into progress
controls or store their results in the artifact. Keep each inline marker at
least 24 pixels and use a 44-pixel close target.

Number every decided intent item in reading order with `01`, `02`, `03`, even when the
list is short. Use body prose weight for each observable condition, reserve
stronger emphasis for the number and marker, and keep the expanded judgment
source label quiet and secondary. When a statement has a reason, keep it in a
native disclosure attached to that statement.

Do not show architecture, modules, algorithms, tools, files, protocols, data
structures, implementation order, test commands, implementation progress,
completion controls, work owners, comments, changed files, test status, or
model and interview metrics.

## Project GUI widgets

Use the relevant group below whenever Hope introduces or changes that widget or
interaction.

A guideline does not create a reason to add a widget that Hope does not need.

When a matching widget exists, follow its guidelines unless a documented
product need, accessibility requirement, or platform convention calls for a
different choice.

The list preserves all 86 guidelines from Jakob Nielsen's [10 GUI Design
Elements Build Every User Interface](https://www.uxtigers.com/post/gui-widgets)
in Hope's language.

### Buttons

1. **GUI-01 — Pressable appearance.** Give a button a contained shape,
   sufficient contrast, and a visible pressed state.
2. **GUI-02 — Outcome label.** Start the label with a verb that names the
   result. Avoid generic labels such as **OK**; if 2–4 words cannot explain the
   result, reconsider the interaction.
3. **GUI-03 — One primary action.** Give each screen exactly one visually
   dominant primary action.
4. **GUI-04 — Reachable target.** Keep frequent actions large and nearby, and
   make a touch target at least 1 by 1 centimeter.
5. **GUI-05 — Prompt acknowledgment.** Show that a press was received within
   0.1 seconds.
6. **GUI-06 — Disabled guidance.** Keep a temporarily unavailable button
   visible but muted, and explain why it is unavailable and how to enable it.
7. **GUI-07 — Action semantics.** Use buttons for actions and links for
   navigation.
8. **GUI-08 — Task-end placement.** Put the button after the fields or content
   it completes, at the natural end of the task.

### Input fields and forms

1. **GUI-09 — Necessary fields.** Remove every field that is not required for
   the task.
2. **GUI-10 — Persistent labels.** Keep a visible label outside every field.
   Treat placeholder text as a hint, never as the label.
3. **GUI-11 — Flexible formats.** Accept reasonable input variations and
   normalize them in software.
4. **GUI-12 — Local recovery.** Put an error beside the field that caused it
   and preserve everything the person entered.
5. **GUI-13 — Task-specific controls.** Match the control to the data and task,
   such as a date picker for a date or a trash control for removal.
6. **GUI-14 — Single-column order.** Lay out a form in one column and group
   related fields so the reading order stays clear.
7. **GUI-15 — Submit outcome.** Name the submit button by the result instead of
   using a generic **Submit** label.
8. **GUI-16 — Validation timing.** Do not reject a value while the person is
   still typing; validate after they leave the field.

### Menus

1. **GUI-17 — User vocabulary.** Name categories in the person's language and
   verify the structure with card sorting and tree testing.
2. **GUI-18 — Click to open.** Prefer click over hover. If hover is necessary,
   add a short delay and tolerate diagonal movement toward a submenu.
3. **GUI-19 — Shallow hierarchy.** Limit cascading menus to two levels and
   restructure categories instead of adding more depth.
4. **GUI-20 — Visible desktop navigation.** Show top-level navigation on a
   desktop and reserve a compact menu for screens that lack the space.
5. **GUI-21 — Current location.** Mark the person's current location in the
   navigation.
6. **GUI-22 — Meaningful order.** Order items by importance and task frequency;
   alphabetize only when people know the exact name they seek.
7. **GUI-23 — Promoted commands.** Keep the two or three most frequent commands
   visible and reserve the menu for less frequent choices.

### Links

1. **GUI-24 — Visible link styling.** Mark an inline link with both color and
   an underline.
2. **GUI-25 — Exclusive link styling.** Reserve link styling for real links.
3. **GUI-26 — Front-loaded meaning.** Put the most informative words first,
   especially within roughly the first 11 characters.
4. **GUI-27 — Predictable destination.** Write link text that predicts its
   destination and remains meaningful outside the surrounding sentence.
5. **GUI-28 — Visited state.** Distinguish visited and unvisited links when an
   interface contains many links.
6. **GUI-29 — Distinct roles.** Do not make a link look like a button or a
   button look like a link.
7. **GUI-30 — Same-tab default.** Open a link in the same tab by default and
   state any exception in the visible link text.

### Dialog boxes

1. **GUI-31 — Blocking use only.** Use a modal only when a decision genuinely
   blocks further work.
2. **GUI-32 — Result labels.** Name each dialog button by its result instead of
   relying on **OK** or **Cancel**.
3. **GUI-33 — Safe defaults.** Default to the safest choice, make **Esc**
   cancel, and never let an accidental **Enter** cause destruction.
4. **GUI-34 — One question.** Ask one question per dialog and explain the
   situation, consequence, and choice in 1–2 sentences.
5. **GUI-35 — Undo reversible work.** Prefer undo over confirmation when an
   action can be reversed.
6. **GUI-36 — Modeless continuation.** Use a modeless dialog when work can
   continue.
7. **GUI-37 — No arrival overlay.** Never interrupt a newly arrived visitor
   with an overlay.
8. **GUI-38 — No dialog stacks.** Never open a dialog on top of another
   dialog.

### Alerts, notifications, and errors

1. **GUI-39 — Plain language.** Explain the state in plain words and never show
   a raw error code as the whole message.
2. **GUI-40 — Exact source.** Identify what failed and point to the field,
   file, or step where it happened.
3. **GUI-41 — Recovery step.** State the way forward in one sentence.
4. **GUI-42 — No blame.** Do not blame the person or use guilt-laden terms such
   as **illegal**, **fatal**, or **invalid user**.
5. **GUI-43 — Proportionate format.** Use a toast for information, a persistent
   inline message for a recoverable error, and a modal alert only for a
   catastrophic condition.
6. **GUI-44 — Redundant status cues.** Communicate status with an icon, color,
   and words rather than color alone.
7. **GUI-45 — Notification restraint.** Keep notifications scarce by default
   and let people control their frequency.

### Icons

1. **GUI-46 — Text pairing.** Pair an icon with text. Use a tooltip only when
   space genuinely prevents a visible label.
2. **GUI-47 — Standard metaphor.** Use the established symbol when one exists
   instead of inventing a replacement.
3. **GUI-48 — Recognition test.** Show a proposed icon by itself to five people
   and ask what it means before trusting the metaphor.
4. **GUI-49 — Coherent set.** Keep one visual style across the icon set while
   giving every icon a distinct silhouette.
5. **GUI-50 — Preserve learned symbols.** Do not redraw a familiar icon merely
   to follow fashion.
6. **GUI-51 — Small favicon.** Reduce the favicon to one strong shape and make
   sure it remains clear at 16 by 16 pixels.
7. **GUI-52 — Rare icon-only buttons.** Reserve an icon-only button for the
   small set of near-universal symbols.

### Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles

1. **GUI-53 — Choice model.** Use checkboxes for independent choices and radio
   buttons for mutually exclusive choices.
2. **GUI-54 — Vertical options.** Stack options vertically so every label has
   an unambiguous control.
3. **GUI-55 — Clickable labels.** Make the whole label activate its control.
4. **GUI-56 — Radio defaults.** Choose a sensible default and add a **None**
   option when abstaining is valid.
5. **GUI-57 — Positive wording.** Phrase choices positively and avoid nested
   negatives.
6. **GUI-58 — Immediate toggles.** Use a toggle only when its setting takes
   effect immediately; use a checkbox when a later submit action commits it.
7. **GUI-59 — One yes-or-no control.** Represent a yes-or-no choice with one
   checkbox instead of two radio buttons.
8. **GUI-60 — Visible small sets.** Show 2–4 choices as radio buttons rather
   than hiding them in a select.

### Tabs

1. **GUI-61 — One row.** Keep tabs in one row and reduce their number or label
   length when they do not fit.
2. **GUI-62 — Short labels.** Name each tab with 1–2 plain words.
3. **GUI-63 — Distinct states.** Connect the selected tab visually to its panel
   and distinguish selected, hovered, and unselected states.
4. **GUI-64 — Parallel peers.** Use tabs only for content of the same type at
   the same level; use a visible step sequence for ordered work.
5. **GUI-65 — Useful default.** Open the tab that most people need first.
6. **GUI-66 — Comparison in one view.** Never split content people must compare
   across tabs; use a comparison table.
7. **GUI-67 — Addressable tabs.** Give each tab its own URL when the platform
   allows it.

### Search

1. **GUI-68 — Visible search box.** Put an open search box near the top of every
   page in a content-rich site instead of hiding it behind an icon.
2. **GUI-69 — Query width.** Make the field at least 27 characters wide so a
   person can see and edit the whole query.
3. **GUI-70 — Familiar submission.** Use a magnifying glass for submission and
   make **Enter** work.
4. **GUI-71 — Forgiving matching.** Tolerate typos, plurals, and synonyms.
5. **GUI-72 — Retained query.** Keep the query in the field on the results page
   so it can be revised.
6. **GUI-73 — Complete results UI.** Use scannable titles, explanatory
   snippets, and filters when the collection needs them.
7. **GUI-74 — Complete index.** Index everything people consider part of the
   site.
8. **GUI-75 — Search-log review.** Review search logs every month and treat
   common queries with poor results as usability defects.

### Windows and scrolling

1. **GUI-76 — Same-window default.** Open content in the current window or tab
   unless the person chooses otherwise.
2. **GUI-77 — Native scrolling.** Never override the speed or direction of the
   platform's scroll gesture.
3. **GUI-78 — Visible scrollbars.** Keep a scrollbar visible for every
   scrollable pane.
4. **GUI-79 — Bounded infinite scroll.** Use infinite scroll only when nothing
   important appears below the list; otherwise provide **Load more**.
5. **GUI-80 — Important content first.** Order content by importance because
   attention declines with each screenful.
6. **GUI-81 — Working Back.** Protect the Back action and avoid gratuitous new
   windows or state changes that break it.

### Pointers and cursors

1. **GUI-82 — Platform cursors.** Use the platform's standard cursors without
   restyling them.
2. **GUI-83 — Truthful cursor.** Show a pointing hand only for a clickable
   element and an I-beam only for editable text.
3. **GUI-84 — Long-wait feedback.** Show a busy indicator for a wait longer
   than 1 second.
4. **GUI-85 — No hover-only path.** Never make hover the only way to reach
   important information or an action.
5. **GUI-86 — Visible keyboard focus.** Give keyboard navigation a visible
   focus indicator.

## Align artifact layout

Give the current intent most of the page and keep version history secondary. In
the wide-screen rail, show the current version and at most one prior version
summary. Open earlier detail from that history instead of repeating it in the
document. When the rail does not fit, include the history in the common
navigation panel opened by one 44-pixel control to the right of the theme
control.

Keep the positive intent statements in one reading column. Present **Not
included** as one compact list in two columns on a wide screen and one column on
a narrow screen. Do not create a matching included-scope column.

Nest an optional flow below the intent statements. Stack outcomes after its
sequence in their original order. Do not invent phase groups or branches that
the artifact data does not contain.

Number decided intent items in reading order and keep their reasons directly
attached. Do not create another decision list.

Show two or three person-facing design directions together in one
comparison section. Keep the same option order. Keep recommendation and
selection labels beside the option title so they do not create a separate
comparison row. On a wide screen, compare each option's title, image,
brief summary, strengths, and trade-offs in parallel; align those shared rows
across the options and stack each complete option on a narrow screen. Inside
each option, put strengths and trade-offs before recommendation and selection
reasons, then put folded references last. Keep the reasons and references
inside the option they explain. Do not repeat these details in a full-width
group below the comparison. Put only context shared by all options below the
comparison in one reading column. Pair every image with useful alt text, and
mark recommendation and selection with words rather than color alone.

Align embeds Hope Sans so it uses the same Hope type family as Diff across
supported hosts. Its palette, spacing, type sizes, and layout values still come
only from Align's own tokens.

## Hope artifact branding

Align, Diff, and Commit Diff embed the fixed Hope Sans files and Hope product
icon under `plugins/hope/assets/`. Diff and Commit Diff also embed Hope Code
from the same asset folder. Each feature still owns how those assets are
applied in its renderer.

Put the Hope icon immediately before **HOPE** in both product bars. Keep the
visible wordmark as the accessible name; the icon is decorative.

## Diff artifact layout

On a wide screen:

- keep the main text at a readable width;
- keep dense body text intentionally smaller than mobile text; and
- do not stretch paragraphs across a large monitor.

On a narrow screen:

- open a compact native collapsible table of contents from an icon-only control
  beside the display control in the product bar;
- do not give the closed table of contents its own body row or vertical gap;
- open its links in a bounded panel directly below the product bar;
- keep the panel vertically scrollable without passing its scroll gesture to
  the document;
- close the open panel with Escape and return focus to its control; and
- use larger body text and touch targets.

Use the same folder mark and repository type treatment as Align. Present the
reviewed commit with the same quiet status treatment that Align uses for its
current version. In both the rail and panel, mark the current section with an
accent bar, quiet tinted background, and its position in the reading order.

Give the common display control a 44-pixel height and give its theme segment a
visible boundary. Keep the pull-request link outside that group. When the
display and contents controls appear together, give them the same height,
border role, and corner radius. Preserve the pull-request link when repository
text is hidden on a narrow screen.

An icon-only control may be narrower, but it must not look like a smaller
control family.

The product bar is the only place that shows repository and pull-request
identity.

The document owns the change-based artifact title. Summary owns the goal. The
product bar owns the compact reviewed commit, and collapsed review information
owns capture time.

Do not add a persistent sentence that explains that an offline artifact does not
update itself.

A complex drawer is allowed only after its focus, keyboard, scroll, and deep
link behavior is tested.

## Diff artifact type

Use three clear roles.

| Role | Font |
| --- | --- |
| Body prose and controls | Hope Sans Medium, from Gmarket Sans |
| Wordmark and headings | Hope Sans Bold |
| Code, commands, paths, and hashes | Hope Code, from D2Coding |

Embed the fixed WOFF2 files in every offline artifact. Commit Diff also embeds
the complete OFL notices so a standalone HTML copy carries the license terms
for its bundled fonts. Use a local sans-serif or monospace fallback only for
characters that the bundled fonts do not contain, and do not synthesize a
missing font weight.

Hope presents the converted files under Hope-owned family names because both
source licenses reserve their original family names.

Keep their source hashes, build commands, and licenses beside the shared fonts
under `plugins/hope/assets/fonts/`.

Use the same compact prose scale as Align and adjust it only through named
tokens. Diff keeps a separate code scale:

| Use | Wide screen | Narrow screen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main body | 14px / 1.58 | 14px / 1.6 |
| Supporting text | 12px / 1.55 | 12px / 1.55 |
| Code | 13px / 1.35 | 14px / 1.35 |
| Page title | 32px / 1.2 | 28px / 1.2 |
| Section title | 18px / 1.4 | 16px / 1.4 |

Keep prose near 60–80 characters per line. Long paths and code may scroll
inside their own region. Text-bearing controls use a minimum height and grow
when text is enlarged without creating page-level horizontal scrolling.

## Diff artifact space and boundaries

Use two border roles:

- a quiet divider for document structure; and
- a stronger component border for controls, code, and separate task or state
  regions.

Give an adjacent vertical boundary to the later block's top edge. Within a
repeated group, put the divider on each item after the first. Do not combine a
previous block's bottom border with the next block's top border.

Do not draw a strong rule between every sentence or row.

Do not nest full component borders inside the first-screen summary.

Compact summary items use rows; their detailed versions may use cards later in
the document.

Use one quiet marker gutter to help the eye follow body content:

- ordinary paragraphs have no marker;
- two or more parallel claims use one small dot each;
- ordered behavior and code steps use `01`, `02`, `03`;
- a status dot, section number, disclosure arrow, or other existing marker is
  not paired with another generic bullet; and
- nested lists stop after one level and use a neutral marker inside.

Keep the first-screen review result especially compact. Render each preview as
a small kind marker, plain importance text, and title, separated by spacing
rather than rules. Do not add a representative status, total, or kind counts.
When no item exists, show one plain empty-result sentence.

Show concrete material scope limits in the same label-and-value grid as the
other synopsis rows, without a generic scope badge. Omit the row when no
material limit exists.

Use semantic `ul` and `ol` elements for content that is a list.

Render the goal as the first label-and-value row in Summary. Keep the
provider's pull-request title and capture time in collapsed review information.

In each full review item, align kind, importance, and any visible basis on one
visual centerline.

Keep kind and importance as outlined markers. When basis changes how the reader
should judge the item, show it as quieter plain text; omit a code basis that the
numbered evidence already makes visible.

## Hope artifact themes

Generate each artifact as one self-contained file that supports light and dark
themes. The initial theme comes from the artifact input or resolved display option:
`system`, `light`, or `dark`. The theme control changes only the open document;
it does not write host configuration or browser storage. Reload restores the
generated initial theme, and print uses the light surface.

## Align artifact color

The light view uses a warm near-white document surface, near-black text, thin
neutral dividers, and blue for navigation and agreement state. The dark view
uses a near-black surface, off-white text, quiet gray dividers, and a brighter
blue accent.

Exact Align values live only in
`plugins/hope/skills/align/scripts/design/tokens.mjs`.

## Diff artifact color

The official light palette is `Sand Paper`: the same warm near-white page and
slightly brighter reading surface used by Align.

It should feel softer than pure white without looking beige or gray.

Exact Hope surface values live only in the Diff feature's
`scripts/design/tokens.mjs`.

Code is a separate visual surface with fixed Hope light and dark colors. A theme
change switches the code surface with the artifact without replacing the Hope
palette outside code.

Use these status roles:

| Meaning | Color role |
| --- | --- |
| Resolve | Red |
| Decide | Amber |
| Verify | Blue |
| Scope | Neutral blue-gray |

Keep importance in text and never use color as the only status signal.

## Diff artifact interaction

Every interaction must still leave useful content when JavaScript is disabled.

Use trusted, fixed scripts only.

Supported interactions can include:

- preview a numbered evidence reference and open its canonical list entry;
- move through the table of contents;
- switch the current document theme;
- try a safe declarative microworld;
- draft an optional quiz response without submitting or saving it; and
- reveal the quiz answer and evidence through a separate disclosure.

Anchor a reference preview to the marker that opened it. Prefer the space below
the marker, flip above when needed, and clamp it to the viewport. Reposition it
after scrolling or resizing while the marker remains visible. On a narrow
screen, use a bottom sheet only when neither side has enough usable height.

Keep a microworld's title, instructions, and model warning visible. Fold its
controls, scenarios, simplifying assumptions, omissions, and evidence into one
native disclosure. These are optional exploration details, not prerequisites
for understanding the behavior summary and flow.

Use the visible quiz question as the response field's persistent label. When
that question and a clear placeholder make the purpose evident, do not repeat a
generic label such as **My answer** or **Selection**. Keep the question
programmatically associated with the field, and give repeated controls unique
accessible names through their questions. A response is never required before
the answer can be opened.

Print omits the reader's transient quiz response and shows every review item,
microworld detail, question, answer, and supporting evidence regardless of the
current disclosure state.

The **Evidence and scope** section is a dense reference appendix. Keep the
section open initially so its source groups, context checks, scope limits,
checked-file group, artifact details, and final numbered evidence list remain
visible as independent disclosures that start closed.

Use native disclosure controls so they work without JavaScript. Opening a
fragment link must reveal every disclosure that contains its target.

Code markup must contain explicit line separators. One source line remains one
visible line without layout styles; long lines scroll inside the code surface
instead of merging with adjacent lines.

Do not make audit completeness look like repeated interface content. Merge
changed-file source metadata into the changed-file table, keep other sources in
a separate small table, and group exclusions that share a reason.

Keep the collapsed interface compact. A closed disclosure occupies only its
summary row and borders; it does not reserve body padding or leave unused parent
spacing.

Keep the understanding-check subsection visible when it is present. Let each
question and its answer open independently instead of collapsing the whole
subsection.

Expanded details must still account for every source, file, and limit.

Keep stable section IDs available for navigation. Do not show a section-copy
control while artifacts use temporary local paths; add copying only when Hope
has a portable publication URL and can show visible success feedback.

Do not add task completion, assignment, comments, or hidden persistence.

## Hope artifact accessibility

Target WCAG 2.2 AA.

Every artifact needs:

- one `h1` and a valid heading order;
- landmarks and a skip link;
- visible keyboard focus;
- text labels for every status;
- sufficient contrast in both themes;
- reduced-motion and forced-colors support;
- useful content at 200% text zoom and 400% page zoom;
- a text alternative for every diagram or interactive explanation; and
- correct `lang`, `dir`, and bidirectional isolation for mixed content.

Keep mobile controls at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.

On a narrow screen, keep status and control labels at 12px or larger.

When an artifact embeds typefaces, supporting labels and interactive summaries
use its medium face and body prose uses its light face.

Test the final file through `file://`, not only through a web server.

## Hope artifact implementation boundary

Repository, provider, and model content is untrusted.

Each renderer inserts authored prose as text and never accepts authored HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, or SVG. Diff separately validates the source URLs it owns;
Align renders only `http` and `https` evidence locations as links.

Diff inserts repository text only as escaped content. It keeps source lines
explicit and distinguishes patch additions, deletions, context, and hunk
headers without a stateful language parser.

Align may embed raster design-direction images only after its runtime verifies
their supported signature, dimensions, and size. It never treats an authored
data URL or SVG as a design-direction image.

Design code may contain feature-local tokens, fixed assets, and small helpers.

Each feature owns its concrete HTML, tokens, and publication boundary. Keep
Align, Diff, and Commit Diff rendering, state, and design sources separate
until another exact invariant earns shared implementation.
